# Customer.io API C# implementation

Implementation of [Customer.io](https://www.customer.io)'s write-only API for .NET.

## Installation

Using Nuget:

    Install-Package CustomerIOSharp

## Usage

We recommend you implement the `ICustomerFactory` interface yourself. Here is a suggested implementation used in one of my projects:

```cs
    public class CustomerFactory : ICustomerFactory
    {
        public ICustomerDetails GetCustomerDetails()
        {
            var user = MembershipHelper.GetCurrentUser();
            return user == null 
                ? null 
                : user.AsCustomer();
        }

        public string GetCustomerId()
        {
            var user = MembershipHelper.GetCurrentUser();
            return user == null
                ? null
                : user.UserId.ToString();
        }
    }
```

Then instantiate `CustomerIo` and call `IdentifyAsync()`:

```cs
var customerIo = new CustomerIo(
    "siteid", 
    "apikey", 
    new CustomerFactory());
await customerIo.IdentifyAsync();
```

You should most likely only call `IdentifyAsync()` whenever the user logs in or is changed.

If you do not want to implement `ICustomerFactory`, you can simply provide the required details to each call:

```cs
await customerIo.IdentifyAsync(User.AsCustomer());
```

Whatever you do, you will have to provide customer data implementing `ICustomerDetails`. It has only two required properties, but any properties you supply in your implementation will be forwarded to customer.io:

```cs
public class Customer : ICustomerDetails 
{
    // these two fields are required:
    public string Id { get; set; }
    public string Email { get; set; }
    // these are my custom fields:
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
}
```

### Custom events

Track a custom event by calling `TrackEvent()`. It takes an event name as the first parameter, the second parameter is any serializable object. Note that it automatically posts using the correct customer (using `ICustomerFactory`), but you can also supply your own.

```cs
await customerIo.TrackEventAsync("signup", new {
	UserGroup = "trial",
	Referrer = "email campaign"
});

// this event has no data and uses a different customer
await customerIo.TrackEventAsync("signup", customerId: "foo");
```

Note that these two variables will be camelcased before being sent to customer.io, so `userGroup` and `referrer` will be available in your transactional campaigns.
